A Go library for declarative, randomly-generated, heterogeneous JSON data
structures.

[Still under development.]

JSON, unlike Go, allows for data structures with mixed types.  These are
most-easily modeled in Go with `map[string]interface{}` (for objects) and
`[]interface{}` (for arrays).  `jfdi` calls these `Map` and `Slice`, for short.

`jfdi` uses higher-order functions extensively -- constructor functions that return
`Generator` functions, which are called to recursively produce the
desired result.  For example, to define a JSON object, use the `Object`
function with a template `Map`.  If any values in the `Map` are also
`Generators`, they are recursively called to fill in the value:

    factory := jfdi.Object( jfdi.Map{
        "name"     : jfdi.Pick("Alice", "Bob", "Carol"),
        "age"      : jfdi.Int(18, 65),
        "ssn"      : jfdi.Digits("###-##-####"),
        "friends"  : jfdi.Array(jfdi.Int(1,3), jfdi.Pick("Dan", "Eve", "Frank")),
    })

    object := factory(jfdi.NewContext())

    fmt.Println(object)
    // {"name":"Carol","age":42,"ssn":"314-15-9265","friends":["Eve"]}

Define custom `Generators` or `Generator` constructors as needed if built-in
`Generator` constructors aren't enough.
